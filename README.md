The Universal Token is a smart-contract framework for creating customisable tokens. Tokens created following the framework are composed of a Token contract to which one or multiple Extension contracts can be connected. 

The Universal Token is compatible with Ethereumâ€™s most used token standards including ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 and ERC1400.  

Dapp developers may use the Universal Token framework to:
- Easily add new features to a token contract
- Reduce the size of a token contract by not deploying and importing unnecessary code
- Reduce development effort by leveraging a library of reusable token contracts and extension contracts

Using the Universal Token API, developers can deploy extensions contracts and plug extensions contract to Token contracts, either at token deployment or in real-time on-chain.

# Quickstart

## Building

The easiest way to get started is by first compiling all contracts 

```shell
yarn build
```

## Deploying a Token

deploying the `ERC20` smart contract requires an `ERC20Logic` contract to be already deployed on-chain

### Truffle

```javascript
  const ERC20Logic = artifacts.require("ERC20Logic");
  const logic = await ERC20Logic.new();
```

### Hardhat

```javascript
  const ERC20Logic = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("ERC20Logic");
  const logic = await ERC20Logic.deploy();
  await logic.deployed();
```

When you have an `ERC20Logic` contract address, you can now deploy the `ERC20` contract

### Truffle

```javascript
  const ERC20 = artifacts.require("ERC20");
  const token = await ERC20.new(
    "ERC20Extendable", //Token Name
    "DAU",             //Token Symbol
    true,              //Allow Minting?
    true,              //Allow Burning?
    deployer,          //The owner address for this token
    initialSupply,     //The inital supply for this token (will be given to owner address)
    maxSupply,         //The absolute max supply for this token
    logic.address      //The address of the ERC20Logic contract
  );
```

### Hardhat

```javascript
  const ERC20 = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("ERC20");
  const token = await ERC20.deploy(
    "ERC20Extendable", //Token Name
    "DAU",             //Token Symbol
    true,              //Allow Minting?
    true,              //Allow Burning?
    deployer,          //The owner address for this token
    initialSupply,     //The inital supply for this token (will be given to owner address)
    maxSupply,         //The absolute max supply for this token
    logic.address      //The address of the ERC20Logic contract
  );
  await erc20.deployed();
```

## Extensions Included

Extensions are a key part of the UniversalToken, the repo comes with 5 extensions ready to be used with a deployed token.

* AllowExtension
  - Only allowlisted addresses can transfer/mint/burn tokens
* BlockExtensions
  - Blocklisted addresses cannot transfer/mint/burn tokens
* PauseExtension
  - Pause all transfer/mint/burns or pause transfer/mint/burns for a specific address
* HoldExtension
  - Token holds are an alternative to escrows allowing to lock tokens while keeping them in the wallet of the investor.

## Deploying Extensions

Before you can attach an extension to your token you must first deploy the extension on-chain. If the extension
is already deployed on-chain then you can skip this step. There shouldn't be any constructor arguments when deploying
an extension, as these arguments will not be accessible by the Extension when it's attached to the token

### Truffle

```javascript
  const AllowExtension = artifacts.require("AllowExtension");
  const allowExtContract = await AllowExtension.new();
```

### Hardhat

```javascript
  const AllowExtension = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("AllowExtension");
  const allowExtContract = await AllowExtension.deploy();
```

## Registering Extensions

Once an extension is deployed on-chain and you have the extension's contract address, you can register the extension to a deployed token. To register an extension, simply use the `function registerExtension(address extension)` function. 

**NOTE: This function can only be executed by the current token manager address. To determine the current token manager address, you can use the `function manager() public view returns (address)` function.**

```javascript
    await token.registerExtension(allowExtContract.address);
```

## Building Extensions

Extensions are smart contracts that give a token contract additional functionality. A common use-case is to have finer control over the conditions of a token transfer, however there are others, such as adding DeFi support built in or price oracles. 

Extensions live on-chain and can be used by many different token contracts at the same time. Each token contract extension registration is independent and keeps its own independent storage. Extension contracts are upgradable by default and therefore follow the same storage rules as [proxy pattern](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/proxies#storage-collisions-between-implementation-versions).

### Getting Started

First import the `TokenExtension` and `TransferData` from the `TokenExtension.sol` file

```solidity
import {TokenExtension, TransferData} from "@consensys-software/UniversalToken/extensions/TokenExtension.sol";
```
