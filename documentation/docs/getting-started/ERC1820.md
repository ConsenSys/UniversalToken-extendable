    The UniversalToken library uses the ERC1820 registry throughout the smart contract arcitecture. 

    To use the library, you **MUST** have an ERC1820 registry deployed on your network. 

    It is likely that there is already an ERC1820 deployed to the network you're using. You can check on the block explorer using the key `0x1820a4B7618BdE71Dce8cdc73aAB6C95905faD24`.

    If there is no registry on the network, run the registry deployment script which deploys the ERC1820 registry at `0x1820a4B7618BdE71Dce8cdc73aAB6C95905faD24`. The script does nothing if the registry already exists in the network.

    To deploy the ERC1820 registry, run the following command:

    ```shell
    yarn truffle exec scripts/deployments/registry.js
    ```

!!! note
    Maybe this page could have a list of networks that have it.
